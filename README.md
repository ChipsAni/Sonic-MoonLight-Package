# Sonic-MoonLight-Package-Engine
A redirect modification of the Open Source Engine: "Sonic Ring Engine"            
Which features general bug fixes, additional content and more.

# **Made By: Sonic Sunshine Team**
SMPE IS Open Sourced, but it will not feature most of the mods since some of them are "Sunshine Team Exclusive"

Game breaking bugs, Better Mechanics and etc. WILL be open sourced. NO MATTER WHAT.


# SMPE Guide: 
**BETTER RAILS MOD:**

Download the Rails rbxm file, and the script that's located in the folder "scripts"  
Once opening ROBLOX STUDIO And having your SRE (Sonic Ring Engine) Set up, Delete everything that's about SRE Rails.
Open the RBXM file in your SRE ROBLOX STUDIO Game and put the Rails in a folder called "Objects" 
Then Copy And Paste (or import) The Script into "StarterPlayerScripts" 
And everything should be good to work!
