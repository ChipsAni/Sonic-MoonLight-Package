# Sonic-MoonLight-Package-Engine
A redirect modification to the Open Source Engine: "Sonic Ring Engine"            
Which features bug fixes, additional content and more.

# **Made By: Sonic Sunshine Team**

As The SMPE IS Open Sourced, it will not feature most of the content I've made for it.


# SMPE Guide: 
**BETTER RAILS MOD:**

Download the Rails rbxm file, and the script that's located in the folder "scripts"  
Once opening ROBLOX STUDIO And having your SRE (Sonic Ring Engine) Set up, Delete everything that's about SRE Rails.
Open the RBXM file in your SRE ROBLOX STUDIO Game and put the Rails in a folder called "Objects" 
Then Copy And Paste (or import) The Script into "StarterPlayerScripts" 
And everything should be good to work!
