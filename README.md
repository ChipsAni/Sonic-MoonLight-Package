# Unbounded-Tech-Package
A redirect Guide for Open Sourced Stuff that are featured in the Unbounded Tech Engine. (POWERED BY DIGITAL SWIRL ENGINE, ORIGINAL BUILD USED FROM HELIX)
Also features the Sonic Moonlight Package which are ports of the original Sonic MoonLight Engine to your own Custom made/Open Source Engines
         
Both features general bug fixes, additional content and more.
Installations are explained in guides below.

# **Made By: Unbounded Tech Team**
SMPE and UTP are partially Open Sourced, meaning not most of it is available to the public.
Some games are powered by Unbounded Tech, and some partially uses Unbounded Tech Code.

Credit Needed for most of the stuff, as some of the stuff here I didn't made. Proper Credit will be displayed in every Guide and Script,
Credit IS Needed.
